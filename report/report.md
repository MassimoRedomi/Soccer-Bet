#### Task 1: Data Storage Design

##### Solution:
**Design and its motivations:**
To store the football data efficiently, I created six tables in PostgreSQL for static data such as clubs, competitions, nations, player statistics, players, and users. This relational database is chosen for its robustness, support for complex queries, and data integrity features. For dynamic data, I used MongoDB (SoccerDB) to store collections like appearances, careers, club games, game events, game lineups, games, and rankings, leveraging its flexibility and efficiency in handling large volumes of unstructured data.

##### Issues:
**Introduce the task:**
The primary challenge was to distinguish between dynamic and static data and choose appropriate storage methods for each. Dynamic data requires fast updates and retrieval, while static data benefits from the relational structure of PostgreSQL.

**Requirements:**
The design meets the assignment requirements by using PostgreSQL for static data, ensuring data integrity and supporting complex queries, and MongoDB for dynamic data, providing flexibility and efficient handling of frequently changing information.

- **Static Data (PostgreSQL):**
  - **Tables:** clubs, competitions, players, nations, player statistics, users
  - **Motivation:** Robust, supports complex queries, ensures data integrity.

- **Dynamic Data (MongoDB):**
  - **Collections:** appearances, careers, club games, game events, game lineups, games, rankings
  - **Motivation:** Flexible, handles large volumes of unstructured data efficiently.

##### Limitations:
To address potential limitations and ensure extensibility:

1. **Identifying Data Types:** User data, for example, is static, created once and stored as needed. Similar assessments were made for other data types.
2. **Data Organization:** Original data from Transfermarkt and additional datasets like nations, player statistics, and user information were organized based on usage needs.
3. **Adding Tables and Collections:** For MongoDB, creating additional collections like rankings simplified data retrieval, given the non-real-time update requirement.
4. **Data Cleaning:** Using pandas and Python, incomplete or damaged data was cleaned, retaining only the most complete rows.

**Extensibility and Adaptability:**
- New tables or collections can be added as needed without disrupting the existing structure.
- The use of PostgreSQL and MongoDB allows handling both structured and unstructured data flexibly.

**Potential Limitations:**
- **Data Updates:** Static data might require manual updates if real-time data is needed in the future.
- **Complex Queries:** More complex queries might be necessary as the system grows, potentially impacting performance.

Overall, the design aims to balance efficiency, scalability, and ease of use, addressing key challenges and limitations proactively.
